        <h1>Haley Ryan</h1>
        <p>I am a full-stack software engineer in Minneapolis with a background in design and contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Becoming a developer is part of my lifelong practice of self-motivated exploration and learning how to make things that are useful, thought-provoking, joy-inducing, and easy to share.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably gardening, filling up sketchbooks, fixing a bike I rescued from the dumpster, planning a themed potluck party, making collages, or scheming about the next thing I want to learn.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in the ways technology can give more than it takes, and how its reach can be more inclusive and less intrusive.</p>
